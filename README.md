# Project-1-Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model that could predict the number of rental bikes required for each hour using the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset. Linear regression, Lasso (L1), Ridge (L2),  Decision Tree, Random Forest,Gradient Boost, and XGBoost algorithms are used to build a model to predict the number of rental bikes required for each hour.

## **Problem Statement**:
 Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is 
 important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the
 waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern.
 The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

## **Dataset**:
  The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, 
 Snowfall, Rainfall, the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
